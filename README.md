## Theory Of Soldering

![soldering fail](Photos/stock-image-fail-soldering-iron-bob-byron-1.jpg)
The purpose of soldering is to join to electronic components together.
Usually this it is to join a component to a circuit board.  
In order for the two parts to join properly there many conditions that
need to be met first. When soldering is done incorrectly, it can cause
electronics to not work or fail later on in their life. The following
sections in the theory of soldering will describe some of the basics for
soldering correctly.

### Soldering Iron Tip Selection and Preparation

#### Conical Soldering Tips

![Conical Soldering Iron Tip](Photos/Conical-Soldering-Iron-Tip.jpg)  
Conical Soldering iron tips may seem like an obvious choice for SMD
soldering, but they aren't always the best because they do not transfer
heat as well due to the small tip. Small tips are not necessary to do
fine pitch SMD soldering. Good flux is necessary for fine pitch solder.
A small tip alone will not prevent solder bridging while soldering.
Conical soldering iron tips usually have a very fine point, this means
that they have less surface area that they can use to transfer heat. In
order for solder to properly [wet](#soldering-wetting) the component and
pcb pad, they must both be above the solders melting point. (About
360°C/ 680°F for Sn63Pb37). In order to help conical soldering tips
transfer heat better, it is recommended to add a small dab of solder to
the tip of the iron to help increase its effective surface area. One
other thing conical soldering iron tips are good at doing is touching up
small solder joints without disrupting components around them.

##### Recap

Advantages:
1. Small tip for very fine work.
2. Can get into small corners unreachable by other tips.
3. Doesn't disturb nearby solder joints

Disadvantages:
1. Small tip doesn't transfer heat very well, it may be hard to heat up
   larger components and pads with this tip.
2. Sometime can be sharp and remove [soldermask](#soldermask) if not
   careful.
3. Small tip can't wick much solder for drag soldering or drag solder
   removal.


#### Flathead(Chisel) Soldering Tips

Chisel Soldering tips are the most versatile solder iron tips. They can
solder big and small components to a PCB. They have a larger surface
area and can do a better job of heating of the component and pcb. It is also possible to solder fine pitch SMD components using [drag soldering](#drag-soldering) and flux.

## Theory Of Soldering

The purpose of soldering is to join to electronic components together.
Usually this it is to join a component to a circuit board.  
In order for the two parts to join properly there many conditions that
need to be met first. When soldering is done incorrectly, it can cause
electronics to not work or fail later on in their life. The following
sections in the theory of soldering will describe some of the basics for
soldering correctly.

### Soldering Iron Tip Selection and Preparation

#### Conical Soldering Tips

Conical Soldering iron tips may seem like an obvious choice for SMD
soldering, but they aren't always the best. Small tips are not necessary
to do fine pitch SMD soldering. Good flux is necessary for fine pitch
solder. A small tip alone will not prevent solder bridging while
soldering. Conical soldering iron tips usually have a very fine point,
this means that they have less surface area that they can use to
transfer heat. In order for solder to proper wet and both the component
and pcb pad, they must both be above the solders melting point. (About
360°C/ 680°F for Sn63Pb37). In order to help conical soldering tips
transfer heat better, it is recommended to add a small dab of solder to
the tip of the iron to help increase its effective surface area.

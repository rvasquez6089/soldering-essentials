## Theory Of Soldering

![soldering fail](Photos/stock-image-fail-soldering-iron-bob-byron-1.jpg)
The purpose of soldering is to join to electronic components together.
Usually this it is to join a component to a circuit board.  
In order for the two parts to join properly there many conditions that
need to be met first. When soldering is done incorrectly, it can cause
electronics to not work or fail later on in their life. The following
sections in the theory of soldering will describe some of the basics for
soldering correctly.

### Soldering Iron Tip Selection and Preparation

#### Conical Soldering Tips

![Conical Soldering Iron Tip](Photos/Conical-Soldering-Iron-Tip.jpg)  
Conical Soldering iron tips may seem like an obvious choice for SMD
soldering, but they aren't always the best because they do not transfer
heat as well due to the small tip. Small tips are not necessary to do
fine pitch SMD soldering. Good flux is necessary for fine pitch solder.
A small tip alone will not prevent solder bridging while soldering.
Conical soldering iron tips usually have a very fine point, this means
that they have less surface area that they can use to transfer heat. In
order for solder to properly [wet](#soldering-wetting) the component and
pcb pad, they must both be above the solders melting point. (About
360°C/ 680°F for Sn63Pb37). In order to help conical soldering tips
transfer heat better, it is recommended to add a small dab of solder to
the tip of the iron to help increase its effective surface area. One
other thing conical soldering iron tips are good at doing is touching up
small solder joints without disrupting components around them.

##### Recap

Advantages:
1. Small tip for very fine work.
2. Can get into small corners unreachable by other tips.
3. Doesn't disturb nearby solder joints

Disadvantages:
1. Small tip doesn't transfer heat very well, it may be hard to heat up
   larger components and pads with this tip.
2. Sometime can be sharp and remove [soldermask](#soldermask) if not
   careful.
3. Small tip can't wick much solder for drag soldering or drag solder
   removal.


#### Flathead(Chisel) Soldering Tips

Chisel Soldering tips are the most versatile solder iron tips. They can
solder big and small components to a PCB. They have a larger surface
area and can do a better job of heating of the component and pcb. It is
also possible to solder fine pitch SMD components using
[drag soldering](#drag-soldering) and flux.

##### Recap

Advantages:
1. Bigger heat reservoir
2. Larger contact surface area can most easily heat component leads and
   pcb
3. Can hold more solder on tip for drag soldering

Disadvantage:
1. Larger top can disturb nearby components or leads.
2. Can't reach tight spaces, like the corners of QFN packages.

#### Solder Tip Preparation

When you first turn a soldering iron on, there will be corrosion on the
tip of the soldering iron. In order to solder you have to transfer heat
from the soldering iron to the part. The Oxide layer on the tip on the
soldering iron act as thermal insulation so it must be cleaned off.

#### How to tin a soldering iron tip
![Oxidized Soldering Tip](Photos/CorrodedSolderingTip.jpg)
1. Add Solder to the tip. This adds fresh tin and lead to the tip along
   with flux. The flux will help to dissolve the oxide layer off the tip
   of the soldering iron.

2. Rub the soldering iron in the brass sponge to rub the oxide layer off of the tip.

Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the soldering iron is shiny and clean with no dull spots.
3. Remove extra solder from the tip using a wet sponge.

4. Your solder tip should nice and shiny as shown in the photo.
